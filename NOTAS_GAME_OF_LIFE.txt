GAME OF LIFE:

Infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells

2 Possible states for each cell live/populated or dead/unpopulated

Every cell interacts with its 8 neighbours (cells that are vertically, horizontally
or diagonally adjacent)

Transitions:
1 - Live Cell with less than 2 live neighbours dies (underpopulation);
2 - Live Cell with 2 or 3 live neighbours lives in the next generation;
3 - Live Cell with more than 3 live neighbours dies (overpopulation);
4 - Dead Cell with exactly 3 neighbours becomes a Live Cell (reproduction);

The initial pattern (board) consists the seed of the system;

The first generation is created by applying the rules for the transitions;

The moment each generation is created is called a "tick";

Each generation is a pure function of the preceeding one.
